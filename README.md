# Game-Dapp
We have made a decentralized app which allows users to trade game assets with games and other users using blockchain.

Right now, users who play games from different providers cannot exchange assets. For example, if someone plays CS:GO provided by Steam , the player cannot sell the 
skin to someone who is playing valorant. Now you might ask how is this possible?

# Traditional Way:

Lets analysie how the traditional way works: 

First you transfer money(Dollars) from credit cards to game eco-system i.e you buy specific game points that can only be used by the game and is refundable i.e
game points cannot be converted to Dollars.

Disadvantages of traditional way: 
1- Money once entered a game ecosystem never leaves.
2- Users cannot directly exchange virtual assets.


# Our Way:

In order to overcome the above challenges ,what we have done is that we have introduced "Pasha Coin", with the help of Pasha Coin you do not need to waste your money.

How it works:

Whenever a user joins the protocal, they are rewarded with 10 Pasha Coins. These can be used for variety of purposes:
1- Peer-Game trade
2- Peer-Peer trade


Peer-Game trade:
Say user A plays valorant and bought a skin for 50,000Rs but now has decided to change game and start playing CS:GO. There is no way this player can transfer this money
to CS:GO, but with the help of Pasha Coin, user can. 
User sells this asset and gets money in the form of Pasha Coin which can be carried to any other game, in this case CS:GO.

Peer-Peer trade:
Say another user wants to sell his asset to some other user. Before this was not possible even in same game! But now with the help of Pasha coin is possible.
User 1's asset's cost is 10 Pasha and user 2 has following options:
	Either pay in pasha coin.
	Or trade with another asset

Implementation: 

We have used python programming language and used socket programming to establish connection between client and server. We have used Object Oriented Programming for
maintaining the block of blockchain.
